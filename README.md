## Project Overview

We as a team collectively decided to choose the MyBlogPost website for our project and the name of our website is Insight Globe. This website will be a platform for users to create, manage and share their personal blogs. The system will allow registered users to search content, write, comment and publish their own blogs. On the other hand, the unregistered users will have limited functionality to just browsing, searching and viewing the content. The website will support multiple users and will be updated in real time. The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly and an interactive environment for users to express themselves and engage with other users on the platform.
